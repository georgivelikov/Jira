  "summary": "When Lexorank duplicate rank problem is fixed through REST API, it does not clear the failure reason",
  "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThis is reproducible on Data Center: yes\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Deliberately update the database so that two rows in the \"AO_60DB71_LEXORANK\" table have the same Rank value. \r\n # Run the Lexorank check in the UI.  It will fail on the last test - the duplicate rank test. \r\n # Follow the [https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-fix-duplicate-rank-values-for-a-rank-field-779159224.html] to get the results of the integrity checks from the endpoint /rest/greenhopper/1.0/lexorank/integrity.  The last check will fail and list the failure reason with the duplicated value.  \r\n # Run the REST API call via Postman to fix the duplicate rank. \r\n # Run the integrity check again from the endpoint   /rest/greenhopper/1.0/lexorank/integrity.  \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nIt will have fixed the Lexorank duplicate and clear the failure reason. \r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe duplicate rank issue is fixed and the test passes but it still lists a failure reason:\r\n{noformat}\r\n\"name\":\"Duplicate ranks check\",\"description\":\"Checks if there are any duplicate rank values for a rank field.\",\"passed\":true,\"failureReason\":\"Detected duplicate ranks for rank field 10100 : {0|i0001j:\u003d2}\",\"fatal\":false  {noformat}\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",

      "text": "It looks like the command explained in the KB article referred above for fixing the duplicates actually fixes one duplicate at a time. Running the command several times until getting no error message for duplicate values, fixes the problem at the end. In my case I had to run the fix command around 25 times to fix all duplicates on Jira V.8.20.7. Maybe it helps for those with low number of duplicate LexoRank duplicate rank values.\r\n\r\n.  "
